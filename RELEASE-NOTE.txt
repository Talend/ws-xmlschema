 Apache XMLSchema 2.0.2 Release Notes
 ====================================

This is the release of Apache XMLSchema 2.0.2.

XMLSchema is a lightweight schema object model that can be used to manipulate 
and generate XML schema representations. It has few external dependencies
and can be easily integrated into an existing project.

You are welcome to kick the tires and get XMLSchema on the move.  Any
contribution in the form of coding, testing, submitting improvements
to the documentation, and reporting bugs are always welcome.

This release fixes the following defects:

** Bug
    * [XMLSCHEMA-18] - tomcat6 memory leak
    * [XMLSCHEMA-20] - Serializing an XmlSchema that imports another schema that doesn't have targetNamespace results in the import having a namespace attribute with empty value
    * [XMLSCHEMA-22] - enum parsing is locale specific
    * [XMLSCHEMA-23] - Namespace declarations for extensor attributes are lost

** Improvement
    * [XMLSCHEMA-24] - When serializing DOM, use setAttributeNS instead of setAttribute


Thanks for your interest in XMLSchema!
